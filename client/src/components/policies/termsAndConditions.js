        <h3><strong>Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements</strong></h3>


        <p>A. Respect of Third Party Rights.  Industry Careers respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our Users to do the same.  Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service.</p>


        <p>B. Repeat Infringer Policy.  Industry Careers intellectual property policy is to (a) remove or disable access to material that Industry Careers believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Service, and (b) remove any User Content uploaded to the Service by repeat infringers. Industry Careers considers a &apos;repeat infringer&apos; to be any User that has uploaded User Content or Feedback to or through the Service and for whom Industry Careers has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User Content or Feedback.  Industry Careers has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon Industry Careers’ own determination.</p>


        <p>C. Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.  If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below.  Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by Industry Careers with the User alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and you hereby consent to Industry Careers making such disclosure.

          <li>Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Industry Careers to locate the material;</li>


          <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit Industry Careers to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;</li>


          <li> A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>


          <li> A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>


          <li>You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>D. Designated Agent Contact Information.  Industry Careers designated agent for receipt of Notifications of Claimed Infringement (the &apos;Designated Agent&apos;) can be contacted at:</p>


        <p>Via E-mail:<a href="mailto:hello@industry.co">hello@industry.co</a></p>


        <p>Via U.S. Mail:   1455 Kettner Blvd Apt 1405 San Diego, CA 92101</p>


        <p>E. Counter Notification.  If you receive a notification from Industry Careers that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Industry Careers with what is called a “Counter Notification.”  To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to Industry Careers Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 20.D and include substantially the following information:</p>


        <ol>

          <li>A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;</li>


          <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>


          <li> A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</li>


          <li>The subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Industry Careers may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 20.C above or an agent of such person.</li>


          <li>A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the partys obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>F. Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.  If you submit a Counter Notification to Industry Careers in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, Industry Careers will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Industry Careers will replace the removed User Content or Feedback or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and Industry Careers will replace the removed User Content or Feedback and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Industry Careers’ Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Industry Careers’ system or network.</p>


        <p>G. False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.  The Copyright Act provides that:</p>

        <p>[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner&apos;s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [Industry Careers] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.</p>


        <p>17 U.S.C. § 512(f).</p>


        <p>Industry Careers reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.</p>

        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, only notices submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or the procedures set forth in this Section 20 should be sent to the Designated Agent at <a href="mailto:hello@industry.co">hello@industry.co</a> or to the postal address or facsimile number identified above.  Any other comments, compliments, complaints or suggestions about Industry Careers, the Service or any other matter should be sent to <a href="mailto:hello@industry.co">hello@industry.co</a></p>


        <h3><strong> SECTION 18: DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></h3>

        <p>A. Mandatory Arbitration.   Please read this carefully.  It affects your rights.  YOU AND INDUSTRY CAREERS AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.</p>

        <ol>

          <li>Commencing Arbitration.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Industry Careers, to you via any other method available to Industry Careers, including via e-mail.  The Notice to Industry Careers should be addressed to Industry Careers, Inc., 1455 Kettner Blvd Apt 1405 San Diego, CA 92101, Attn: Chief Executive Officer (the “Arbitration Notice Address”).  The Notice must (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the specific relief sought (the “Demand”).  If you and Industry Careers do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Industry Careers may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court.  THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE “Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT.  The Rules and AAA forms are available online at http://www.adr.org.  If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against Industry Careers, then Industry Careers will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Industry Careers’ receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.</li>


          <li>Arbitration Proceeding.  The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.  A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in San Diego County, California, shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein.  You and Industry Careers agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (A) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (B) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>


          <li>No Class Actions.  YOU AND INDUSTRY CAREERS AGREE THAT YOU AND INDUSTRY CAREERS MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISON IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.</li>


          <li>Decision of the Arbitrator.  Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.  The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice.  All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.  The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.  The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration.  You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.  The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in these Terms.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>B. Equitable Relief.  The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution section do not apply to any claim in which Industry Careers seeks equitable relief of any kind.  You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of the Terms by Industry Careers or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Industry Careers, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in the Terms.</p>


        <p>C. Claims.  You and Industry Careers agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to the Terms or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.  Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>


        <p>D. Improperly Filed Claims.  All claims you bring against Industry Careers must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section.  All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution section will be considered improperly filed.  Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution section, Industry Careers may recover attorneys&apos; fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that Industry Careers has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>


        <p>E. Modifications.  In the event that Industry Careers makes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration provision (other than a change to Industry Careers&apos; Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Industry Careers&apos; Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with Industry Careers and your license to use the Service shall terminate immediately, and this Dispute Resolution provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive the termination of the Terms.</p>


        <p>F.Enforceability.  If only Section 21.a.iii or the entirety of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 21 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 22 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Terms.</p>


        <h3><strong> SECTION 19:  GOVERNING LAW &amp; CHOICE OF FORUM</strong></h3>
        <p>The laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern the Terms and your use of the Service.  Your use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.  To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Diego County, California, and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.</p>
